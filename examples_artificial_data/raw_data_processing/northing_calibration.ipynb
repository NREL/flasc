For example, if a turbine is shedding a wake on a second turbine, then for a fair comparison both of these two turbines should be operating normally. If the upstream turbine is curtailed or offline, the power production of the downstream turbine also changes. Hence, if we are unsure about the operating mode of one machine, we cannot make accurate FLORIS predictions on the second turbine either. In this scenario, we would classify the second turbine's measurement as faulty too, because of this."
