# FLASC documentation


Welcome to the documentation of the NREL FLASC repository!

```{note}
FLASC v2.3 now requires `numpy` version 2, following the update in FLORIS v4.3. See the [numpy documentation for details](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/numpy_2_0_migration_guide.html).
```

FLASC provides a rich suite of analysis tools for SCADA data filtering &
analysis, wind farm model validation, field experiment design, and field
experiment monitoring. The repository is centrally built around NRELs
in-house [FLORIS](https://github.com/NREL/floris/discussions/)
 wake modeling utility.

FLASC also largely relies on the energy ratio to, among other things, quantify wake
losses in synthetic and historical data, to perform turbine northing
calibrations, and for model parameter estimation.

The FLASC repository is intended as a community driven toolbox, available on
its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NREL/flasc).
