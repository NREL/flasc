# Total uplift

Total uplift in energy production can be computed from one dataframe to another.  It uses a similar input as the [energy ratio](energy_ratio) but returns a single value representing the total uplift, rather then binned by wind direction.

Currently the main example usage of the total uplift function is at the end of [smarteole example 06](https://github.com/NREL/flasc/blob/main/examples_smarteole/06_wake_steering_energy_ratio_analysis.ipynb)
