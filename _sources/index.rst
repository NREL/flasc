Welcome to the documentation of the NREL FLASC repository!

FLASC provides a rich suite of analysis tools for SCADA data filtering & 
analysis, wind farm model validation, field experiment design, and field 
experiment monitoring. The repository is centrally built around NRELs
in-house `floris <https://github.com/nrel/floris>`_ wake modeling utility.
FLASC also largely relies on the energy ratio to, among others, quantify wake
losses in synthetic and historical data, to perform turbine northing
calibrations, and for model parameter estimation.

The FLASC repository is intended as a community driven toolbox, available on
its `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/NREL/flasc>`_.
