Overview
--------
FLASC provides a rich suite of analysis tools for SCADA data filtering & 
analysis, wind farm model validation, field experiment design, and field 
experiment monitoring. The repository is centrally built around NRELs
in-house `floris <https://github.com/nrel/floris>`_ wake modeling utility.
FLASC also largely relies on the energy ratio to, among others, quantify wake
losses in synthetic and historical data, to perform turbine northing
calibrations, and for model parameter estimation.

Literature
==========
See :cite:`Doekemeijer2022a` and :cite:`Bay2022a` for a practical
example of how the flasc repository is used or processing and analyses of
historical SCADA data of three offshore wind farms.

Module overview
=================
FLASC consists of multiple modules, including:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
flasc.dataframe_operations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This module includes functionality to easily manipulate Pandas DataFrames.
Functions include filtering data by wind direction, wind speed an/or TI,
deriving the ambient conditions from the upstream turbines, all the while
dealing with angle wrapping for angular variables.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
flasc.energy_ratio
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
this module contains classes to calculate and visualize the energy ratio as
defined by Fleming et al. (2019). The energy ratio is a very useful quantity
in SCADA data analysis and related model validation. It represents the amount
of energy produced by a turbine relative to what that turbine would have
produced if no wakes were present. Various classes are included in this model,
from classes used to calculate and plot the energy ratio for a single dataset,
a class for multiple datasets, and a class that calculates the wind direction
bias for every turbine by maximizing the energy ratio fit between FLORIS and
SCADA data. Various visualization methods are included such as energy ratio
plots and automated generation of detailed excel spreadsheets to determine
where and which turbines performed differently than expected. These methods
can be used both for model validation and for processing field campaign data,
e.g. baseline vs optimized operation.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
flasc.floris_tools
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This module contains functions that leverage the floris model directly. This
includes functions to calculate a large set of floris simulations (with MPI,
optionally) for different atmospheric conditions, yaw misalignments and/or
model parameters. It also includes two functions to precalculate and
respectively interpolate from a large set of model solutions to speed up
further postprocessing.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
flasc.model_estimation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This is a module related to the estimation of parameters in the floris wind
farm model. One class herein, called floris_sensitivity_analysis, performs
Sobol parameter sensitivity studies to determine which parameters are most
sensitive in various situations (atmospheric conditions, turbine settings,
wind farm layouts).

++++++++++++++++++
flasc.optimization
++++++++++++++++++
The optimization module includes functions to estimate the timeshift between
two sources of data, for example, to sychronize measurements from a met mast
with measurements from SCADA data. The module also includes a function to
estimate the offset between two timeseries of wind direction measurements.
This is useful to determine the northing bias of a turbine if you know the
correct calibration of at least one other wind turbine. Finally, this module
also contains a function to estimate the atmospheric turbulence intensity
based on the power measurements of the turbines inside a wind farm.

+++++++++++++++++++++++
flasc.raw_data_handling
+++++++++++++++++++++++
This module contains functions that supports importing and processing raw
SCADA data files. Specifically, it provides a class called
"sql_database_manager" which can be used to up- and download data between
your local system and a remote SQL database. This class also contains a GUI
to visualize data existent in the remote repository. This repository also
includes data handling for very large datasets. Data is saved in feather
format for optimal balance of storage size and load/write speed.
Additionally, can split one large dataframe into multiple dataframes and
feather files.

+++++++++++++++++++++++
flasc.time_operations
+++++++++++++++++++++++
This module allows the user to easily downsample, upsample and calculate
moving averages of a data frame with SCADA and/or FLORIS data. These functions
allow the user to specify which columns contain angular variables, and
consequently 360 deg wrapping is taken care of. It also allows the user
to calculate the min, max, std and median for downsampled data frames. It
leverages efficient functions inherent in pandas to maximize performance.

+++++++++++++++++++++++
flasc.turbine_analysis
+++++++++++++++++++++++
this module allows the user to analyze SCADA data on a turbine level. Outliers
can be detected and removed. Filtering methods include sensor-stuck type of
fault detection and analysis of the turbine wind speed-power curve.
