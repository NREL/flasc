Installation
-----------------
FLASC is currently not available as a package on any repository manager.
Instead, it must be installed by the user by cloning the GitHub repository.

To download the source code, use `git clone`. Then, add it to
your Python path with the "local editable install" through `pip`.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Download the source code.
    git clone https://github.com/NREL/flasc.git

    # Install into your Python environment
    pip install -e flasc

If everything is configured correctly, any changes made to the source
code will be available directly through your local Python. Remember
to re-import the FLASC module when changes are made if you are working
in an interactive environment like Jupyter.
