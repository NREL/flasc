# FLORIS-Based Analysis for SCADA Data (FLASC)


**Note:** Further documentation is available at **https://nrel.github.io/flasc/**

## Description

FLASC provides a **rich suite of analysis tools** for SCADA data filtering, analysis,
wind farm model validation, field experiment design, and field experiment monitoring.

The repository is centrally built around NRELs in-house ``FLORIS`` wind farm model, available at
**https://github.com/nrel/floris**. FLASC also largely relies on the ``energy ratio``, among others,
to quantify wake losses in synthetic and historical data, to perform turbine northing calibrations,
and model parameter estimation.

For technical questions or concerns, please email paul.fleming@nrel.gov.

## Engaging on GitHub

FLORIS leverages the following GitHub features to coordinate support and development efforts:

- [Discussions](https://github.com/NREL/flasc/discussions): Collaborate to develop ideas for new use cases, features, and software designs, and get support for usage questions
- [Issues](https://github.com/NREL/flasc/issues): Report potential bugs and well-developed feature requests
- [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/NREL/projects/39): Include current and future work on a timeline and assign a person to "own" it

Generally, the first entry point for the community will be within one of the
categories in Discussions.
[Ideas](https://github.com/NREL/flasc/discussions/categories/ideas) is a great spot to develop the
details for a feature request. [Q&A](https://github.com/NREL/flasc/discussions/categories/q-a)
is where to get usage support.
[Show and tell](https://github.com/NREL/flasc/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) is a free-form
space to show off the things you are doing with FLORIS.
