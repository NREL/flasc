    "Specifically, the reference variables are calculated using the average wind direction, wind speed, and power values from turbines SMV1, SMV2, SMV3, and SMV7 (turbines 000, 001, 002, and 006 in the FLASC convention), which generally experience freestream inflow for the wind directions of interest (195-200 degrees). Wind direction and wind speed-dependent correction factors are then applied to the reference wind speed and power values to remove biases from the wind speed and power of the controlled turbine SMV6 during baseline operation. Lastly, a correction is applied to the reference wind speed signal to better represent the freestream wind inflow using a nacelle transfer function derived from nacelle lidar measurements.\n",

    "Note that FLASC uses the column names \"wd\", \"ws\", and \"pow_ref\" for the reference wind direction, wind speed, and power. To avoid interfering with these names, we'll call the reference variables used in the SMARTEOLE experiment \"wd_smarteole\", \"ws_smarteole\", and \"pow_ref_smarteole\"."
